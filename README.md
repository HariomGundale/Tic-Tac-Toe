## 📁 Project Structure

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The board is a 3×3 grid of clickable cells.

2. Players take turns placing their symbol (❌ or ⭕).

3. After each move:

     -The script checks for a winning combination (rows, columns, or diagonals).

     -If found → the winner is announced.

     -If all cells are filled and no winner → it’s a draw.

4. The Reset button clears the board and starts a new game.
